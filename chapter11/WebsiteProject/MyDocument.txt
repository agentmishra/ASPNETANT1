Tchotchkes Employee Manual

Section 23.5: Flair
People can get a cheeseburger anywhere. They come to Tchotchkie's 
for the atmosphere and the attitude. That's what the flair's about. 
It's about fun.

Employees will wear a minimum of 15 (fifteen) articles of flair.
Flair may be worn on shirts or suspenders, and should be evenly
spaced. Please note that, while 15 articles of fliar is the minimum,
we hope that our food service specialists will go above the minimum.
